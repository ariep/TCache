{- | TCache is a transactional cache with configurable persitence that permits
STM transactions with objects that syncronize sincromous or asyncronously with
their user defined storages. Default persistence in files is provided by default

 TCache implements ''DBRef' 's . They are persistent STM references  with a typical Haskell interface.
simitar to TVars ('newDBRef', 'readDBRef', 'writeDBRef' etc) but with added. persistence
. DBRefs are serializable, so they can be stored and retrieved.
Because they are references,they point to other serializable registers.
This permits persistent mutable Inter-object relations

For simple transactions of lists of objects of the same type TCache implements
inversion of control primitives 'withSTMResources' and variants, that call pure user defined code for registers update. Examples below.

Triggers in "Data.TCache.Triggers" are user defined hooks that are called back on register updates.
.They are used internally for indexing.

"Data.TCache.IndexQuery" implements an straighforwards pure haskell type safe query language  based
 on register field relations. This module must be imported separately.

"Data.TCache.IndexText" add full text search and content search to the query language

"Data.TCache.DefaultPersistence" has instances for key indexation , serialization
 and default file persistence. The file persistence is more reliable, and the embedded IO reads inside STM transactions are safe.

"Data.Persistent.Collection" implements a persistent, transactional collection with Queue interface as well as
 indexed access by key

-- * Operations with cached database references
{-|  @DBRefs@ are persistent cached database references in the STM monad
with read/write primitives, so the traditional syntax of Haskell STM references
can be used for  interfacing with databases. As expected, the DBRefs are transactional,
 because they operate in the STM monad.

A @DBRef@ is associated with its referred object trough its key.
Since DBRefs are serializable, they can be elements of mutable cached objects themselves. They could point to other mutable objects
and so on, so DBRefs can act as \"hardwired\" relations from mutable objects
to other mutable objects in the database/cache. their referred objects are loaded, saved and flused
to and from the cache automatically depending on the cache handling policies and the access needs


@DBRefs@ are univocally identified by its pointed object keys, so they can be compared, ordered checked for equality so on.
The creation of a DBRef, trough 'getDBRef' is pure. This permits an efficient lazy access to the
 registers trouth their DBRefs by lazy marshalling of the register content on demand.

Example: Car registers have references to Person regiters

@
data Person= Person {pname :: String} deriving  (Show, Read, Eq, Typeable)
data Car= Car{owner :: DBRef Person , cname:: String} deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Typeable)
@


Here the Car register point to the Person register trough the owner field

To permit persistence and being refered with DBRefs, define the Indexable instance
for these two register types:

@
instance Indexable Person where key Person{pname= n} = "Person " ++ n
instance Indexable Car where key Car{cname= n} = "Car " ++ n
@

Now we create a DBRef to a Person whose name is \"Bruce\"

>>> let bruce =   getDBRef . key $ Person "Bruce" :: DBRef Person

>>> show bruce
>"DBRef \"Person bruce\""

>>> atomically (readDBRef bruce)
>Nothing

'getDBRef' is pure and creates the reference, but not the referred object;
To create both the reference and the DBRef, use 'newDBRef'.
Lets create two Car's and its two Car DBRefs with bruce as owner:

>>> cars <- atomically $  mapM newDBRef [Car bruce "Bat Mobile", Car bruce "Porsche"]

>>> print cars
>[DBRef "Car Bat Mobile",DBRef "Car Porsche"]

>>> carRegs<- atomically $ mapM readDBRef cars
> [Just (Car {owner = DBRef "Person bruce", cname = "Bat Mobile"})
> ,Just (Car {owner = DBRef "Person bruce", cname = "Porsche"})]

try to write with 'writeDBRef'

>>> atomically . writeDBRef bruce $ Person "Other"
>*** Exception: writeDBRef: law of key conservation broken: old , new= Person bruce , Person Other

DBRef's can not be written with objects of different keys

>>> atomically . writeDBRef bruce $ Person "Bruce"

>>> let Just carReg1= head carRegs

now from the Car register it is possible to recover the owner's register

>>> atomically $ readDBRef ( owner carReg1)
>Just (Person {pname = "bruce"})



DBRefs, once the pointed cached object is looked up in the cache and found at creation, they does
not perform any further cache lookup afterwards, so reads and writes from/to DBRefs are faster
than *Resource(s) calls, which perform  cache lookups everytime the object is accessed

DBRef's and @*Resource(s)@ primitives are completely interoperable. The latter operate implicitly with DBRef's

In this example \"buy\" is a transaction where the user buy an item.
The spent amount is increased and the stock of the product is decreased:

@
data  Data=   User{uname:: String, uid:: String, spent:: Int} |
              Item{iname:: String, iid:: String, price:: Int, stock:: Int}

 where

       | stock it > 0= [us',it']
       | otherwise   = error \"stock is empty for this product\"
      where
       us'= us{spent=spent us + price it}
       it'= it{stock= stock it-1}
    buyIt _ = error \"either the user or the item (or both) does not exist\"

-- * Trigger operations
{- | Trriggers are called just before an object of the given type is created, modified or deleted.
The DBRef to the object and the new value is passed to the trigger.
The called trigger function has two parameters: the DBRef being accesed
(which still contains the old value), and the new value.
If the content of the DBRef is being deleted, the second parameter is 'Nothing'.
if the DBRef contains Nothing, then the object is being created

Example:

Every time a car is added, or deleted, the owner's list is updated.
This is done by the user defined trigger addCar

@
 addCar pcar (Just(Car powner _ )) = addToOwner powner pcar
 addCar pcar Nothing  = readDBRef pcar >>= \\(Just car)-> deleteOwner (owner car) pcar

 addToOwner powner pcar=do
    Just owner <- readDBRef powner
    writeDBRef powner owner{cars= nub $ pcar : cars owner}

 deleteOwner powner pcar= do
   Just owner <- readDBRef powner
   writeDBRef powner owner{cars= delete  pcar $ cars owner}

 main= do
    'addTrigger' addCar
    putStrLn \"create bruce's register with no cars\"
    bruce \<- 'atomically' 'newDBRef' $ Person \"Bruce\" []
    putStrLn \"add two car register with \\"bruce\\" as owner using the reference to the bruces register\"
    let newcars= [Car bruce \"Bat Mobile\" , Car bruce \"Porsche\"]
    insert newcars
    Just bruceData \<- atomically $ 'readDBRef' bruce
    putStrLn \"the trigger automatically updated the car references of the Bruce register\"
    print . length $ cars bruceData
    print bruceData
@

gives:

> main
> 2
> Person {pname = "Bruce", cars = [DBRef "Car Porsche",DBRef "Car Bat Mobile"]}

-- * Cache control
{-- |

The mechanism for dropping elements from the cache is too lazy. `flushDBRef`, for example
just delete the data element  from the TVar, but the TVar node
remains attached to the table so there is no decrement on the number of elements.
The element is garbage collected unless you have a direct reference to the element, not the DBRef
Note that you can still have a valid reference to this element, but this element  is no longer
in the cache. The usual thing is that you do not have it, and the element will be garbage
collected (but still there will be a NotRead entry for this key!!!). If the DBRef is read again, the
TCache will go to permanent storage to retrieve it.

clear opertions such `clearsyncCache` does something similar:  it does not delete the
element from the cache. It just inform the garbage collector that there is no longer necessary to maintain
the element in the cache. So if the element has no other references (maybe you keep a
variable that point to that DBRef) it will be GCollected.
If this is not possible, it will remain in the cache and will be treated as such,
until the DBRef is no longer referenced by the program. This is done by means of a weak pointer

All these complications are necessary because the programmer can  handle DBRefs directly,
so the cache has no complete control of the DBRef life cycle, short to speak.

a DBRef can be in the states:

- `Exist`:  it is in the cache

- `DoesNotExist`: neither is in the cache neither in storage: it is like a cached "notfound" to
speed up repeated failed requests

- `NotRead`:  may exist or not in permanent storage, but not in the cache


In terms of Garbage collection it may be:



1 - pending garbage collection:  attached to the hashtable by means of a weak pointer: delete it asap

2 - cached: attached by a direct pointer and a weak pointer: It is being cached


clearsyncCache just pass elements from 2 to 1
